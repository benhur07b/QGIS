## About QGIS

[QGIS](https://qgis.org) is a full-featured, user-friendly, free-and-open-source (FOSS) Geographic 
Information System (GIS) that runs on Unix platforms (e.g. Linux), Windows, and MacOS.

### Under the hood

QGIS is developed using the [Qt toolkit](https://qt.io) and C++, since 2002, and has a pleasing, easy-to-use graphical user interface with multilingual support. It is maintained by an active developer team and supported by a vibrant community of GIS professionals, enthusiasts, geospatial data publishers, and end-users. 

### Versions and release cycle

[QGIS development and releases follow a time based schedule/roadmap](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html). There are three main branches of QGIS that users can install. These are the **Long Term Release (LTR)** branch, **Latest Release (LR)** branch, and the **Development (Nightly)** branch.

- **Long Term Release (LTR)** is maintained and receives bug fixes until the next LTR is released. Currently, an LTR is released every year.
- **Latest Release (LR)** refers to the release version of QGIS that contains the most recent or latest features. A new LR is released every four (4) months. Currently, every 3rd LR becomes the next LTR.
- **Development/Nightly** is based on the most recent version of the QGIS source code. It is not recommended for production environments but is useful if you want to test, debug, or help in the development of QGIS.

Every month, there is a **Point Release** that provides bug-fixes to the LTR and bug-fixes as well as new features to the LR.

### Free and Open Source

QGIS is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) Version 2 or above. Developing QGIS under this license means that you can (if you want to) inspect and modify the source code and guarantees that you, our happy user, will always have access to a GIS program that is free of cost and can be freely modified.

QGIS is part of the Open-Source Geospatial Foundation ([OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/)), offering a range of complementary open-source GIS software projects.

The [building guide](INSTALL.md) can be used to get started with building QGIS from source.

For installation of QGIS Server, see its [getting started documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/server_manual/getting_started.html).


## Help and Support Channels

There are several channels where you can find help and support for QGIS:

- Using the QGIS community site at [https://qgis.org](https://qgis.org)
- Joining the [qgis-users mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-user)
- Chatting with other usesrs real-time. *Please wait around for a response to your question as many folks on the channel are doing other things and it may take a while for them to notice your question. The following paths all take you to the same chat room:*
    - Using an IRC client and joining the [#qgis](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#qgis) channel on irc.freenode.net.
    - Using a Matrix client and joining the [#qgis:matrix.org](http://matrix.to/#/#qgis:matrix.org) room.
    - Using [Gitter](https://gitter.im/qgis/QGIS?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) chat.
 - At the [GIS stackexchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) or [r/QGIS reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/QGIS/), which are not maintained by the QGIS team, but where the QGIS and broader GIS community provides lots of advice
- [Other support channels](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/support.html)


## Get Involved with the Community

### Bug reporting and bug fixing

You can contribute to the project **by submitting bug reports or fixing bugs** in the [QGIS bug tracker](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/).

### New features and enhancements

If you wish to contribute patches you can [fork the project](https://help.github.com/forking/), make your changes, commit to your repository, and then [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/). The development team can then review your contribution and commit it upstream as appropriate.

If you commit a new feature, add `[FEATURE]` to your commit message AND give a clear description of the new feature. A webhook will automatically create an issue on the QGIS-Documentation repo to tell people to write documentation about it.

For large-scale changes, you can open a [QEP (QGIS Enhancement Proposal)](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals). QEPs are used in the process of creating and discussing new enhancements or policy for QGIS. All QEP's are created as new issues and should generally be created for (only examples):

- Large application wide changes (e.g major UI redesign)
- Large work with wider scope (e.g something that might effect how layers are loaded.)
- Community processes and policies (e.g 3.0 release)

Generally smaller features do not require a QEP unless they can have large knock on effect. Bug fixes do not require a QEP.

### Translations

Help translate QGIS to your language. At this moment about forty languages are already available in the Desktop user interface and about eighty languages are available in transifex ready to be translated.

The [translation](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/translate.html) process is managed by the [Translation Team](https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/governance.html#gui-translation) and all the activities are done under the [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) platform.

### Other ways to contribute

If you are not a developer, there are many other possibilities which do not require programming skills to help QGIS to evolve. Check our [project homepage for more information](http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/index.html).
